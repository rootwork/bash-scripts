# Boilerplate code

This folder is just a local source for reusable patterns and snippets.

This does result in repeated code and some maintenance overhead, but allows scripts to be self-contained, rather than loading these utility pieces in order to run.

Files are NOT executable Bash scripts; they are saved as `.sh` only to aid with
Bash syntax highlighting.
