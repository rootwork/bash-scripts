# Add a watermark image to a video. You do not need to know the dimensions of
# the video or the watermark image, just how far from the lower-right corner
# you want the watermark to be. A new video will be output with "-marked"
# appended to the file name.
#
# This is barely more than an alias, but is a lot easier than remembering all
# the configuration parameters.

# USAGE

# Run the script with a path to the video, a path to the watermark file, and the
# distance (in pixels) you want the watermark to appear from the lower-right
# corner.
